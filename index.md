Simply navigate to the top of VS Code where it says "Terminal," and select "New Terminal." I inputted the following command into the terminal, with the zz replaced by my CSE 15L account id:
```
$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
I was met with a few messages after this, and simply inputted yes to what the terminal asked. After, I was remotely connected and this is what my terminal looked like:
